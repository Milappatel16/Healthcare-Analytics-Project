_**Project Description – CABG Outcomes Analysis**_

This project investigates regional disparities in Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) outcomes across the United States, with a focus on mortality, hospital costs, discharge patterns, and Medicare spending efficiency. Using CMS and AHRQ datasets, the analysis benchmarks regions to evaluate the quality and value of cardiac surgical care.Research Focus

**Research Focus**

  a) Quantify 30-day mortality rates and in-hospital death percentages across regions.
  
  b) Compare normalized Medicare expenditures and hospital costs per stay.
  
  c) Examine discharge disposition (routine home discharge vs. institutional care).
  
  d) Assess value trade-offs: high-cost/low-mortality vs. low-cost/high-mortality clusters.

**Key Insights**

  a) Northeast states (NY, NJ, PA): Consistently lower mortality and tighter performance variation, but higher hospital costs per stay.

  b) West South-Central states (TX, AR, OK, LA): Higher mortality and variability, with lower costs and higher routine discharge rates.
  
  c) Statistical tests confirm significant regional differences (p < 0.05) in costs, mortality, and discharge outcomes.
  
  d) Weak correlation (r² < 0.001) between spending and mortality indicates that resource use alone does not drive outcomes—care quality and system efficiency matter more.

**Policy & Clinical Implications**

  a) Regional benchmarking can identify high-value models (better survival at sustainable cost).
  
  b) Cost vs. outcome trade-offs highlight that spending reductions cannot come at the expense of survival outcomes.
  
  c) Results support the need for evidence-based quality improvement initiatives and more equitable resource allocation strategies across regions.
